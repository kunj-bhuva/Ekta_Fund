        At EktaFund, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

      <p style={{ color: '#4f5d75', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
        We collect information that you provide to us directly, such as when you create an account, make a donation, or contact our support team. 
        This information may include your name, email address, payment details, and other personal data necessary for the donation process.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#1a535c', marginTop: '20px' }}>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p style={{ color: '#4f5d75', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
        The information we collect is used to facilitate the donation process, improve our platform, communicate with you about your donations, and 
        send updates on projects and NGOs you support. We may also use your information for internal analytics to improve our services.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#1a535c', marginTop: '20px' }}>Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p style={{ color: '#4f5d75', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
        We do not share your personal information with third parties, except as required to complete the donation process (e.g., payment processing) 
        or comply with legal obligations. In such cases, we ensure that our partners also comply with data protection laws.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#1a535c', marginTop: '20px' }}>Security of Your Information</h2>
      <p style={{ color: '#4f5d75', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
        We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
        However, no method of transmission over the internet is entirely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
